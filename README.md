# Dreamscape VSCode theme

This purple inspired theme should make you hear Prince in your head all day. And if you don't like Prince... then I really don't know what to tell you.

Many VSCode themes do not have distinct borders between elements, or at the edge of the window. This has caused the edges to get lost in my sea of windows. I've made sure to create distinct borders, for ease of window swapping when screen sharing.
